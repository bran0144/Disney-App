# Disney Touring Plans App

## Created by Matthew Tassone & Katherine Gott

### For CS340 Intro to Databases at Oregon State University

### Our app.py code borrowed significantly from the flask starter app code https://github.com/osu-cs340-ecampus/flask-starter-app

### We updated the code to match our columns and added routes for out M:N relationships between Touring Plans and Restaurants and Touring Plans and Rides.  

### Original work: We added pages for our M:N relationship to display in a separate plan_view.j2. Some of the code within plan_view.j2 comes from the above flask-starter-app.
